![Tag](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=LeadingRepository&color=green&style=flat)

This project is a Frontend web application for the value added services project written in React.js

## Description

This project is mainly a dashboard which displays information from the [value added service country risk backend](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/vas-country-risk-backend) project. 
This dashboard calculates a risk score per country based on information regarding corruption, political stability, economic risk and social and structural figures.

## What is a Country risk?

Country risk refers to the risk of investing or lending money in a country, arising from possible changes in the business environment that may adversely affect operating profits or the value of assets in the country. For example, financial factors such as currency controls, devaluation or regulatory changes, or stability factors such as mass riots, civil war and other potential events contribute to companies' operational risks. This term is also sometimes referred to as political risk - however, 
country risk is a more general term that generally refers only to risks affecting all companies operating within or involved with a particular country.
